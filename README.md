# Hello!
Welcome to my Home Page. Look around, explore, or just relax. This is a safe zone. Also if you are feeling generous, hit the follow button. I might not post a lot but I like to post some things.

Right now, I made a website on Wix. But that's only a placeholder website >:)
I'm going to try to make a website with my own code and by typing. It might take a while but I could do it. I just never give up

# Scratch Life
Well I have a career on Scratch. I own a company (collaboration) called Aspect Inc. and I am the founder of the most active collaboration and the most viewed OPEN thread on the forums, AspectOS. I am trying my best to keep these alive while also having my own Scratch career. I post 4 times a month on Scratch. January 2022 was the month with the most shared projects in a while! 6 or 7! They were filler projects but they got a lot of attention. I am hosting something called "Clicking Until" which is when I click the stage until something happens. Usually they take about an hour so you don't miss it (also because there are cheeky stream snipers)

# My Dream
Like everybody, I have a goal and a dream. I want to become interested in business and technology. I feel like they could really help me in the future. I am also trying my best to learn different programming languages so I can create apps that will interest people on the Internet. I am also trying my best to learn about the problems in the world and I'm trying to find solutions for these problems. 

# Self Taught
I was self taught HTML. In 3rd grade, I got an intro to it but I forgot it 2 weeks after because I was that type of kid that just wanted to play kickball or video games. But then I got into middle school, where I matured, a lot. I started to look for websites that might help me and I came across Glitch, a code editor website. So I signed up for it and I started HTML. It was hard for me at first but I got the hang of it. And then I was introduced to Replit, another code editor website. It started making sense and just like that, I was writing code and making websites. It was amazing. And then I taught myself CSS after 6 hours of experimenting in Notepad++ one day. And I haven't mastered it, yet. I still have a long way to go and I will never give up

# Videos
So, I don't have a YouTube channel. Why? I may or may not be too young. I believe that you need to be 14+ to create a channel. I haven't clarified it yet though and I might have to double check that. Or maybe it is 13. But instead of having a YouTube channel, I am making my own website and I am using a screen recording extension to make 5 minute videos. They could be reviews, gaming videos, or just random videos. But I try to make good content and I do this for free. I don't care about the money at the moment. I care about the community and the problems they are facing. I really want to help the Internet and I don't want to start a war. I'm trying my best to talk to people, even if I have social anxiety. 

# AspectOS
So as I stated earlier, I created a company/collab on Scratch. AspectOS. It was just by itself and I was the only person working on it. At first, I called it AIGamesOS. But that didn't work out so I changed the name to something unique. Something that nobody has thought of. AspectOS. I was sure that people on scratch didn't even know the word "Aspect" so I stuck with it. And it died during the summer of 2021. But in September 2021, I brought it back and it blew up. First 1000, then 2000, then 5000, then 15000. Next thing I knew, I was ahead of collaborations that were a year or more older and AspectOS (thread) was only 2 or 3 months old. But I won't let fame control me. I am still trying my best with my team and we are going to make one of the best OSes on Scratch!

# Updates
I am going to be updating this a lot. If I have something important, I will share it here. Okay bye! Oh wait, please hit the follow button, please! Thanks!
